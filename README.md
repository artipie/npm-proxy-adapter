# npm-proxy-adapter

## Usage
This is the dependency you need:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.artipie</groupId>
  <artifactId>npm-proxy-adapter</artifactId>
  <version>[...]</version>
</dependency>
```

## How it works?

After initial setup of the proxy repository, it can be used to work with NPM.
NPM registry to install package from can be specified explicitly 
`npm install --registry=https://artipie.com/npm-proxy-registry <package_name>` or setup 
as default with `npm set registry https://artipie.com/npm-proxy-registry` command. 

NPM sends HTTP requests to specified URL and adapter processes them. It proxies 
request to the remote repository previously setup. After getting artifact, it caches 
received data and transform before sending it back to client. The next request will not 
require remote repository call - the cached data will be used.
